debalot
=======

A (quite silly) package to manage deb files using Python.

Uses Protocol Buffers as its data storage scheme.


## Getting involved
Right now, debalot is in the earliest stages of development. I'd rather not
bring too many people in yet, but if you're interested, email me.
As always with open source software, you are free to fork to your heart's
content. As long as your code works, is fully tested, and is readable, I'll
probably accept patches back even if you don't contact me first, but no
promises, as I do have a rough vision for 1.0.
