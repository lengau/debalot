package (0.0.3) stable; urgency=critical

  *A line here that doesn't have a space after the asterisk.
  A line with no asterisk at all, not carrying on from a previous one.
  [ One person ]
  * I don't like empty lines at all
  [ Other person ]
  * This is really really super important. So important that I'm going to write
    an entire paragraph telling you why, including:
   - A random bullet point
   - Actually make that two. Maybe more in just a bit. I'm not really sure. But
     first I want to interject with this second line
   - Yeah, let's have a third bullet point.
  * Oh, I like new lines so I'm going to put in a few with some whitespace.
    They should be parsed out anyway. But the lack of a line before this and
    the next package entry is intentional.

package (0.0.2) stable testing unstable contrib; urgency=low (HIGH if you were affected by some arbitrary bug or something)

  * I don't like that optional blank line, so I'm not doing it.
  * I do like multiple entries, though. Especially when one of the entries
    ends up going onto the next line.
  * Even moreso if it's followed by another entry.

  * That space was intentional. Not putting one below here, though.
